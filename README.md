# Using the Leanpub API with Perl

After reading the notice in Google groups from Scott Patten about the
Leanpub API, my first thought was: I want to use this with perl.

And then I wrote the perl module.

This book may be used as additional documentation to the perl module.

But it's main purpose is to test the Perl binding of the Leanpub API.

So you probably don't want to get noticed about new releases.
